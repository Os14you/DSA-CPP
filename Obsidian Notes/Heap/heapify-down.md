Starting from the root node as long as one of its children is smaller, shift the parent to the smallest child node and move down.

![[Heapify-Down.excalidraw|800]]

In this example, we need to fix the binary heap after we make the first step, so we start from the root element if itâ€™s greater than one of its children we swap it with the small one and move down.

```cpp
void heapify_down(int idx) {
	int child_left  = left(idx );
	int child_right = right(idx);

	int mn = std::min(child_left, child_right); 
	if(mn == -1 || heap[idx] < heap[mn])
		return;

	swap(heap[idx], heap[mn]);
	heapfiy_up(mn);
}
```
