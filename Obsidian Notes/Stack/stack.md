It’s about stacking elements on top of each others, where you can only access the top element. It works with a concept called **FILO** ... First In Last Out.

Some of its functionalities will be `{cpp}push(element)`, `{cpp}pop()`, `{cpp}peek()` and it’s all only uses the top element.

Stack is a **logical** data structure, so we use underlay memory structure to build it, it can be scattered (e.g. [[linked-lists|Linked Lists]]) or consecutive (e.g. [[arrays|Arrays]]).
