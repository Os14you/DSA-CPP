The tree data structure is a way of representing a tree like information **upside-down** so it have a root where all the coming nodes well get from it and links between each parent node and its children.

Each tree node is called a node (or **vertex**) and the links also called **edges**, and there are some important definitions:
- ***Height:***  the **number of edges** on the **longest downward path** between the root and a leaf.
> Tree of N levels has N-1 height
- ***Depth:*** the number of edges from **the node** to the **root node**.
