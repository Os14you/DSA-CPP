It is the way that we know how much memory and time will it require the code to run in memory. (*mostly in a approximation level*)

- [[time-complexity|Time Complexity:]] where we care about how much **time** the algorithm needs to take when running the code.
- [[space-complexity|Space Complexity:]] where we care about maximum **memory** that the algorithm needs to take when running the code.

There is some different types of notations that we are using in asymptotic analysis, the most common one is [[Big-O-notation|Big O notation]] but there is another types . . [[Big-Theta-notation|Big Theta notation]] and [[Big-Omega-notation|Big Omega notation]].
